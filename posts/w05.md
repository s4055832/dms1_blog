This is my second edition of mindmap, and I've changed the overall design concept: nine ICONS are all in one site on climate change issues. The audience is teenagers and young adults, as well as people interested in climate change. The age range is between 15 and 35.
In this version of mindmap, I removed icons about weather modification tools, refugees and skin cancer.An icon about AR meditation, an icon about Real-time weather conditions in mountain forests and an icon about climate white noise have been added. ICONS of trackless mountains and glacial funerals were made into games.I think this change can make the content of my website more similar and more coordinated.

Among the icons of real-time weather conditions in mountain forests, the first one uses the image of clouds to represent the weather. The second is an icon that mimics a glacier funeral, a transparent box with images of the sun, clouds and so on. The third is a wide-angle view of sunlight and clouds next to the sun. The fourth is to use the image of mountains and clouds to emphasize the concept of mountains and forests in the content. The fifth is to show different weather signs in the form of signs.

Among icons about white noise, the first one aims to use dots and line segments to abstractly express the visual effects of white noise sound effects. The second is the image of reflecting light with water waves. The third is a kaleidoscope of white noise visualizations. The fourth is to use the thickness of the wavy line not to show a circle, but also visual sound effect. The fifth is to use three parallel wavy lines to express the sound more directly.

The first of the ICONS of meditation is the distortion of the circle to express the spiritual relaxation of the person in meditation. The second image, which uses a sound bowl, is more apparent in the outward form of meditation. The third uses the sun, and the imagery of clouds reinforces the theme of the AR meditation icon, which is climate. The fourth is to mimic the icon of the virtual community so that they appear to be a group. The fifth uses the image of ripples to express the scene of rain, which is often used in meditation.

I think the second one is the best.The fiest one is a little boring.And the third and forth one are complex.Purple and green are contrasting colors, and this combination can stimulate visitors entering the site and attract their attention. And the larger area of green is also in line with the website about the impact of climate on the environment, more attention to the theme of natural change.
