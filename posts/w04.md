Black Squares
![blacksquares](/w04s1/blacksquares.jpg)
When designing black squares, it's convenient to get a same square by pressing ALT and dragging a black square. And by pressing SHIFT, we can get squares quickly. If the black squares are over border, we can copy a background and set it on the top of other layers.
in designing these icons, I want to use the relationship of four squares to show the different theme. For example, I use three big squares to pressure the space of the forth square to show the meaning of tension.

In assignemnt2, climate is the most atrracted to me.

The seventh draft is better. In the draft, lines representing the wind are the main project. And two birds show the wind obciously.

In the first set, I used elements of sunlight and umbrellas. The first one is looking up at the bottom of the umbrella which means we're under the umbrella. The second is the emphasis on sunlight, using the form of tree-ring to show the pressure of sunlight. The third one shows from the side that the sun cannot penetrate the umbrella. The fourth is to emphasize that the light shines on the surface of the umbrella. The fifth is that the light rays from the outside are directed towards the central sphere, but cannot penetrate the sphere.I think the fifth is the best.

In the second set, the first was drawn from the point of view of the signal transmitter. The second is to turn the emitted rays into flat circles. The third is to highlight the location of the signal with a map. The fourth is the representation of signal emission in the form of a bar chart. The fifth is to combine the signal it emits with the clouds to show the effect of the signal on the weather.I think the forth is the best.

In the third group, the first was the entire map. The second manifestation is the gathering place of climate refugees. The third is to keep the map only close to the equator, emphasizing the affected areas of climate refugees. The fourth shows the escape path of climate refugees in the form of a broken line. The fifth is to synthesize multiple escape paths and put them on a map.I think the fifth is the best.

In the fourth group, there are five different flight patterns of birds, and I think the third one is the best. Because the second and fourth ICONS are similar to most of the ICONS, the first and fifth ones show a more mediocre attitude towards the bird's flight, with no positive feelings.

In the sixth group, the first one used two blank game cards stacked on top of each other as an icon. The second is holding three game cards in one hand. The third is to split a game card into two pieces and turn it into a puzzle, which fits in with the game format of climate fresk. The fourth is to enrich the pattern of the third puzzle. The fifth is a four-piece puzzle with weather-related patterns. I think the fifth is the best.

In the seventh group, the first one wanted to use sticker mosaics of trees and lakes to show our ability to control nature in the game. The second is to use the overhead map to divide the community with green belts, representing the virtual community in the game. The third is to turn neat green belts into meandering rivers. The fourth was to become an empty land with flowers and flowers on it. The fifth added a path through the flowers and plants to make it look more alive.I think the fifth is the best.

Of the eighth group, the first one directly uses the environmental label. The second uses the tent icon to emphasize that the audience is campers and hikers. The third simplifies the tent icon from the second. The fourth combines the tent icon from the third with a line in the shape of a mountain. It is emphasized that the location is a mountain forest. The fifth icon weakens the proportion of tents and emphasizes mountain forests, showing that mountain forests are the focus of this app. I think the fifth is the best.

In the ninth group, the first one used a picture of the side of the snow mountain to realistically emphasize the image of the snow mountain. The second is a dotted line of icebergs, highlighting the melting of icebergs. The third is a small iceberg floating in the sea. The fourth is several icebergs floating in a cuboid filled with water. The fifth is to draw the part of the iceberg above the water in the fourth icon with dotted lines. I think the fourth is the best.
