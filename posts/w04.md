Black Squares
![blacksquares](/w04s1/blacksquares.jpg)
When designing black squares, it's convenient to get a same square by pressing ALT and dragging a black square. And by pressing SHIFT, we can get squares quickly. If the black squares are over border, we can copy a background and set it on the top of other layers.
in designing these icons, I want to use the relationship of four squares to show the different theme. For example, I use three big squares to pressure the space of the forth square to show the meaning of tension.

In assignemnt2, climate is the most atrracted to me.
